Welcome to the Geometry in Context Homepage! Here are links to the
projects' three components:

* `Transformations Video and In-Class Activities <|filename|/pages/transformations.rst>`_:
  These cover the four basic transformation types, with emphasis on
  dilations.
* `Trigonometry Video and In-Class Activities <|filename|/pages/trigonometry.rst>`_: These
  cover basic trigonometry, with special emphasis on the tangent
  function.
* `Volume Video and In-Class Activities
  <|filename|/pages/volume.rst>`_: These cover the problem of
  calculating basic volumes and applying Cavalieri's principle.

We've Moved!
------------

As of April, 2016, the new homepage for the project is
http://geometry-in-context.github.io/. Eventually, the link
http://math.arizona.edu/~jthomas/gic/ will be taken down, so please
plan accordingly.

About the Project
-----------------

*Geometry in Context* is a mathematics outreach project funded by the
University of Arizona / NASA Space Grant Graduate Fellowship Program
in 2014-2015. The project consists of a collection of animated films
that demonstrate connections between science, everyday
problem-solving, and geometry.

Since August of 2014, this site has received visits from people in
more than 120 cities and 32 countries. If you use these materials in
your classroom, it would be great to hear from you! The best way to
reach me is by email at jthomas@email.arizona.edu. Teacher feedback
is always appreciated.
