Welcome to the Geometry in Context Homepage! Here are links to the
projects' three components:

* `Transformations Video and In-Class Activities <|filename|/pages/transformations.rst>`_:
  These cover the four basic transformation types, with emphasis on
  dilations.
* `Trigonometry Video and In-Class Activities <|filename|/pages/trigonometry.rst>`_: These
  cover basic trigonometry, with special emphasis on the tangent
  function.
* Volume Materials: This part is still under development. When
  finished, it will cover the problem of calculating volumes and
  applying Cavalieri's principle.


About the Project
-----------------
*Geometry in Context* is a mathematics outreach project funded by the
University of Arizona / NASA Space Grant Graduate Fellowship Program
in 2014-2015. When completed, the project will consists of a
collection of 4-5 minute long animated films that demonstrate
connections between space-science, everyday problem-solving, and
geometry.

Currently we have completed two films: *Transformations* and
*Trigonometry*. *Transformations* discusses the four basic types of
geometric transformations needed to understand Euclidean geometry.

The film *Trigonometry* is designed to introduce students to
trigonometric ratios and build understanding of how these ratios are
used to solve real-world problems.

This Spring we are creating a third film on the topic of volume and
Cavalieri's principle.

Since August of 2014, this site has received visits from people in
more than 120 cities and 32 countries. If you use these materials in
your classroom, it would be great to hear from you! The best way to
reach me is by email at jthomas.mweinrich@gmail.com. Teacher feedback
is always appreciated.
