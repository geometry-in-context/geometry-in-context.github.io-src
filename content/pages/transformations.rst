Transformations are fundamental tools for understanding and discussing
geometry. This film examines *dilations*, one of the four basic types
of transformations, and discusses how dilations are related to a
machine called a *pantograph*.

Teaching Materials and Activities
=================================

Question 1
----------

In the video, we saw how to dilate a shape using just a pencil and
straight-edge. Use this technique to dilate the letter K below by a
factor of 2.  Use point c as your center point for the dilation.

Question 2
----------

In the video, we considered a pantograph that dilates shapes by
a factor of 2. That machine had the following design:

.. figure:: {filename}/images/pantograph.png

**Part 1:** How would you change the pantograph to dilate shapes by a
factor of 1/2? Justify your answer geometrically.

**Part 2:** How would you change the pantograph to dilate shapes by a
factor of 3? Justify your answer geometrically.

Question 3
----------

Suppose an inventor presents you with the design for a drawing machine
shown below. She claims that if you trace a shape with the stylus, the
machine will draw a copy of the shape translated 10cm to the
right. Explain why this machine performs a horizontal translation 10cm
to the right.

You should assume:

- Dots represent hinges, and the two squares are fixed to the
  tabletop.
- On each of the horizontal white bars, the distance between the hinge
  points is 10 cm.
- The shaded bars are all of equal length.
